# Game Recorder

Game Recorder is a plugin for [SmartBot](http://sb-forum.com/) (an intelligent Hearthstone bot) that records games by taking screenshots and saving relevant logs turn-by-turn. Misplay reports can be created live at the press of a hotkey. Recorded games can also be analyzed post-mortem to see what went wrong and report misplays. See [configuration](#configuration) for complete list of features.

## Installation & Usage

1. Download the [GameRecorder.cs](https://github.com/levinson/GameRecorder/raw/master/GameRecorder.cs) file to your SmartBot ```Plugins``` directory.
2. Enable the GameRecorder plugin and set desired configurations (see next section).
3. Start the bot and watch the ```RecordedGames``` folder in its root directory.
  * A new folder is created for each game (e.g. ```2015-12-05 163737 Rogue vs. Shaman```)
  * Screenshots are captured live throughout the game.
  * A misplay report folder is created each turn the misplay hotkey is pressed.
  * Logs are saved for each turn (or when bot is stopped).
  * Folder name is appended with ```WIN``` or ```LOSS``` when the game ends.
  * Seeds are copied when the game ends (or when bot is stopped).
4. Review screenshots and log files to analyze what went wrong in games.

Note that the bot can be stopped and started without interfering with GameRecorder.

## Misplay Reporting

First off there are two types of misplays. For misplays during mulligan create a post in the [SmartMulligan thread](http://sb-forum.com/index.php?/topic/5930-requestfeedback-smartmulligan/). For all other misplays create a new thread in the [SmartCC AI Misplay forum](http://sb-forum.com/index.php?/forum/31-smartcc-ai-misplay/).

Next, locate the relevant log files and screenshots to include in your post. If you pressed the misplay hotkey when the misplay occurred, then attach all the files inside the misplay folder. If you noticed the misplay while analyzing a recorded game, then attach only the files for the turn on which the misplay occurred.

Finally, be sure to include any relevant details in your report such as what the bot did, what you expected it to do, and why.
